  "empatiaShortAnswer": "Since 2018 our goal has been to provide a safe and engaging space for children and adults to learn and grow.",
  "empatiaLongAnswer": "Empatia Produtos Psicopedagógicos is a brazilian company, and since its founding has been dedicated to providing a safe and engaging space for children and adults to learn and grow.\n\nOur journey began with the launch of Jogo Empatia, an innovative emotional intelligence card game designed to foster empathy and understanding. This initial product featured a single box with 3 different types of cards: feelings, what's important, and choices.\n\nIn 2020, we launched two new boxes, introducing 6 new types of cards: areas of life, thoughts, paths of self-discovery, body awareness, body parts, and bodily sensations.\n\nAll of the cards were designed to be modular, allowing users to mix and match cards to create unique and personalized learning experiences.\n\nIn 2024, we are excited to bring the essence of our physical products to the digital world with the launch of the Empatia app. This app version of our beloved card game continues our mission of fostering emotional intelligence and personal growth, providing a modern and accessible platform for users to explore and develop their skills.\n\nAnd after the launch of the Empatia app, in collaboration with mental health professionals, we developed the Empatia Track app to assist and support everyone seeking to understand their mental health.",
